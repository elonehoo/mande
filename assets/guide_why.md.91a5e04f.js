Of course, we also combine the synchronous and asynchronous in JavaScript. concept. Forwarding requests in mande can also be synchronous and asynchronous. When we choose synchronous mande, we will directly return the content returned by the target server. If we choose asynchronous, unsuccessful requests will be stored, and subsequent requests will be made until the request is made. success.</p><p>Of course, there is another advantage of using mande.
