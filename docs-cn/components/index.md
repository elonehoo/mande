# introduce

## core

This is the core package of mande.
Mande is a middleware that interacts through HTTP requests,
so its initial template is very simple,
and its scalability is also weakened,
but it satisfies the forwarding requirement very well.
This is also the advantage of mande.

## lib

This is a springBoot plug-in for mande,
which can be used as simple as we use Service to use mande.
Of course, if there is any extension to mande,
then this plug-in also needs to be changed accordingly.
Of course, we will follow the business and skills in the future.
Update to update the extensibility of this plugin.
